    <blockquote>
      I am truly grateful to have Amber as my Functional Medicine practitioner – she is passionate about her work and deeply committed to my healing journey. It can be incredibly overwhelming to navigate the different things happening in my body, particularly when allopathic medicine simply wants to give me pharmaceuticals. Amber has helped me look at the many facets of what I am dealing with, and has helped me to understand the connections between them in a way that is accessible, and gives me hope that my body will heal.

      I can be changed by what happens to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it.

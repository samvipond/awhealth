      I am truly grateful to have Amber as my Functional Medicine practitioner – she is passionate about her work and deeply committed to my healing journey. It can be incredibly overwhelming to navigate the different things happening in my body, particularly when allopathic medicine simply wants to give me pharmaceuticals. Amber has helped me look at the many facets of what I am dealing with, and has helped me to understand the connections between them in a way that is accessible, and gives me hope that my body will heal.

  <div class='about-main'>
    <h2>Ready to feel Like You Again?</h2>
    <p>I’m passionate about medicine that is natural, evidence-based & effective. Having you feel your best is the goal. It is possible!  Having been chronically ill myself, I know what it’s like. Becoming a mother felt similar to being a endurance athlete with little recovery time. Learning to manage stress, eat well & rest enough can seem impossible when you don’t feel well. Prior to studying medicine I trained in dance & I traveled. This lifestyle led to joint pain, hormone & energy issues. Like many people, I suffered from gut issues that didn’t make sense.  My immune system crashed & I developed infections that wouldn’t heal.  With chronic brain fog & digestive pain I never felt at my best.</p>
    <h2>An Ancestral Approach Makes All the Difference</h2>
    <p>I started working for a master herbalist. I wildcrafted medicinal plants & harvested from her garden.  Around this same time, I met the doctor who became my first Functional Medicine teacher. I was on the way to developing an autoimmune disease when he had me adopt an ancestral diet. That was in 2003. This approach has since become known as the autoimmune protocol with research that backing it. I’ve seen it help hundreds recover their health & live well using similar principles. An ancestral approach is not a fad but a system rooted in our genetics. We can adapt to the stresses of today in a way that makes sense. As a result I enjoy much better health now then I did at 20 years ago.</p>
    <h2>Harnessing Your Genetics</h2>
    <p>Functional Medicine allowed me to heal my gut, manage stress & access my vitality.  When gut health is compromised so is immune, brain & hormone function. We are unique in how we adapt to the challenges of our time. Our food systems, toxin load & social environment has changed quickly.  The health of our ecosystems are not separate from our bodies. Evidence-based optimism is a reminder that everything is not as dire as we think. We can continue to create systems that support regeneration. My patients tend to be engaged in their health. Once we have the right information, it can be easy to cultivate the road to optimal health.</p>
    <h2>Informed, Preventative & Cost-Effective</h2>
    <p>If you’ve ever felt at a loss with conventional medicine or anxious that something has been missed then welcome!  We apply evidence-based research & use lab testing to discover the underlying cause of your symptoms. I offer classes & written resources to support your journey. My goal is that you are as informed as possible so you can make the best decisions for you & your loved ones. I want you to apply this knowledge with your family & community.  Our healthcare system needs a preventative & cost-effective approach. The epidemic of chronic inflammatory disease is not how humans have evolved to live. Aligning with our genetics means we engage the hard-wired physiology that has allowed us to live well & thrive.</p>
    <h2>Trust Your Body</h2>
    <p>I work with people who are fed up with being in pain, having low energy & not sleeping well. If you want to trust your body, feel at home in your skin & live a full, vital life then you are in the right place. The best medicine catches & prevents disease before it is full blown. It is thorough, empowering & treats the root cause. This is how I’ve been trained in & how I have helped thousands of people. </p>
    <p>I use functional lab testing, botanical medicine and individualized treatment plans.  Functional medicine is rooted in evidenced-based research that is current.  When I was sick I knew a different approach was needed if I was going to get my life back. I’m excited to be part of a growing movement that is not about disease management.  This is a deeper level of healthcare. Welcome!</p>

      <p>You have your diagnosis, what now?  When I realized that my GP knew very little about celiac disease, I knew I was going to need more help with my healing. Research led me to look for a trained functional medicine practitioner – someone on the ground to work with me and find the root cause of my auto-immune disease. I needed a plan to regain my health.</p>
      <p>My journey with Amber Wood has been amazing. Amber conducts a thorough in-depth review of my case, listens to me, recommends lab tests and the dietary changes I need.  Then she applies her extensive knowledge to correct the underlying issues. I finally have answers, and see results! Functional medicine should be the norm. I recommend Amber Wood Health to anyone looking for results-oriented medical care.</p>

      <p>I just wanted to add a note of appreciation to you for the excellent care and the kindness you have extended to me.You have validated my symptoms and by listening carefully, you have recommended supplements that have given me most of my energy back. The time you spent when I had questions, was valuable in my being able to incorporate your recommendations.</p>

    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <p>I began studying Functional Medicine and Acupuncture in 2003 after my own health crisis. I returned from Asia with more pathogens in my gut than the lab tech had ever seen. After having a ‘gut’ or intuitive response to conventional medicine’s approach to gastro-intestinal distress, I decided to change my life and move to Nelson, BC.  This small mountain town is where I met my doctor and teacher. The first changes I made were adding more protein, healthy fats and salt to my diet. Secondly I began eating more vegetables and meditating.</p>
    <p>Having been a vegetarian throughout my teens and early twenties weakened my constitution. I was training six days per week as a dancer and this, combined with the wrong diet for my activity level, made me an excellent host for opportunistic, pathogenic bacteria. I quit dancing and traveled. Climbing mountains, eating vegetarian and drinking treated water led to further gut distress, infection and severe fatigue.</p>
    <p>As my understanding grew and my strength returned I committed to a year long barefoot doctor training.  I wanted to help others with similar gastro-intestinal distress. After working in community healthcare and education for years I decided to return to school and became a licensed practitioner. I’ve treated hundreds of patients over the past six years  and now work with people around the globe.  I’m dedicated to ongoing study, research, and sharing what I learn with you.</p>

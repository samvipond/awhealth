    <h1>Step One: Your Initial Consultation</h1>
    <p>We’ll look at the many of factors influencing your health. The lab tests we order depend on your individual circumstances, and may include:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Advanced stool testing screens for parasites, fungal overgrowth, intestinal inflammation, dysbiosis, digestive function and deficiency of beneficial bacteria. Specific markers for liver, gluten sensitivity and breakdown of protein.</li>
      <li>Breath tests check for upper gastrointestinal infections like h. pylori and small intestine bacterial overgrowth.</li>
      <li>Organic acids tests check neurotransmitters, enzymes, and nutrients. Screens for toxic exporsure, bacterial infections & fungal overgrowth. Can be supportive for ruling out oxalate and other sensitivities.</li>
      <li>Comprehensive hormone testing for HPA-axis/adrenal function and sex hormones including hormone metabolism.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>You will be provided with a health history questionnaires to complete. This is an opportunity to reflect on your goals, history and it makes our time together much more effective. These may include:</h2>

      <h1>Step Two: Treatment Plan</h1>
      <p>Prior to your 2nd consult, any new labs will be reviewed and used to create a treatment plan. This will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A discussion of the underlying patterns that are contributing to your symptoms.</li>
        <li>An outline of the suggested treatment plan, including dietary, supplement and lifestyle recommendations.</li>
        <li>Recommendations for further testing if necessary.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Step Three: Support & Following Up</h1>
      <p>Implementing your treatment plan takes having the right support.  When I look back at why some patients are successful and others struggle it comes down to support.  Getting your health back requires implementing your plan and surrounding yourself with the right support.</p>
      <p>Once the Case Review is complete, please book in follow-up appointments as needed.  You can talk with Amber to decide what makes sense for you.  The frequency of will depend upon your condition and how you respond to treatment. </p>

      <h1>Case Review Fees</h1>
      <p>The Case Review is the fastest and most efficient way to determine the underlying causes of your health problems and design an effective treatment plan. While a Case Review may cost more up front, it is designed to save you money and time over the long-term by doing a deep dive at the beginning. Many people spend a lot of time and money spinning their wheels but never solving their health issues. Health problems can interfere with having a fulfilling personal & work life.</p>
      <p><strong>Here is a breakdown of the costs involved in the Case Review:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The Case Review: </strong>This includes your initial & case review consultation plus two follow-ups. You determine the pace. Typically it takes 3-6 months.  If needed this can be broken down into a monthly payment plan.</p>
      <p><strong>Functional Lab Work: </strong>Functional labs for the case review are $150 – $500 each.</p>
      <p><strong>Supplements: </strong>These may part of your treatment plan after the Case Review. The cost could be between $0 – $200.</p>
      <p><strong>Total of Case Review Fees: </strong>The total for the entire Case Review process with is approximately $597 – $1500.</p>
